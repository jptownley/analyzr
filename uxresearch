Great, you're on the right track with your questions for the user research interviews. Given your focus on gauging product effectiveness and tracking responses over time, it's crucial to ensure that your script facilitates in-depth, actionable insights. Here's a structured approach to your script, aligning with your 30-minute timeframe and the objectives you've outlined:

**Introduction (5 minutes)**
1. **Welcome and Purpose:** Briefly introduce yourself and the team (researcher, observer, note taker), and explain the purpose of the interview.
2. **Confidentiality and Consent:** Assure the participant about anonymity and confidentiality, and obtain their consent for recording or note-taking.
3. **Warm-up Question:** Ask a simple, non-intrusive question to build rapport (e.g., “How long have you been using our product?”).

**Core Questions (20 minutes)**
1. **Product Effectiveness:**
   - “What aspects of our product are working well for you?”
   - “Where do you see opportunities for improvement?”
   - “What features or changes would you like to see in the future?”
   - “Do you have any other key feedback or suggestions for us?”

2. **Specific Experiences (last 90 days):**
   - “In the past 90 days, have you used remote printing with your badge? Can you describe that experience?”
   - “Have you visited Tech Express or worked with a field technician? Please tell us about that.”
   - “What has been your experience with ordering software or hardware?”
   - “Have you used a 'hotel' or unassigned seating area? What was that like?”

3. **Support Level Assessment:**
   - “How would you rate the level of support you've received from us?”
   - “What level of support do you expect or desire from our services?”
   - “Based on your experience, what are some actions or follow-ups you would recommend us to take?”

**Conclusion (5 minutes)**
1. **Wrap-up:** Thank them for their time and valuable insights.
2. **Next Steps:** Explain how their feedback will be used and what the next steps will be.
3. **Open Floor:** Give them a moment to add anything else they might want to share.

**Post-Interview (Team Debrief)**
- Briefly discuss initial impressions and key takeaways.
- Plan for data compilation and analysis.

Remember to keep the tone conversational, and be prepared to ask follow-up questions for clarity or deeper understanding. Good luck with your user research interviews!
