Certainly! Here's a brief guide for the researcher on how to create a copy of a Confluence page and anonymize participant names:

### Creating a Copy of a Confluence Page

1. **Navigate to the Original Page:**
   - Open the Confluence page you want to copy.

2. **Copy the Page:**
   - Look for the three dots (...) in the page menu at the top right.
   - Click on "Copy."

3. **Set New Page Details:**
   - A new page editor will open with the content copied from the original.
   - Give the new page a distinctive title, such as "User Interview - [Date-Time]."
   - Update any other necessary details like labels or parent page, if needed.

4. **Save the New Page:**
   - Once you've made the necessary changes, click "Publish" to create the new page.

### Anonymizing Participant Names

1. **Replace Names with Codes:**
   - In the copied Confluence page, replace the participant's name with a unique identifier. For instance, use the date and time of the interview: "Participant_2024-01-03_10AM."

2. **Maintain a Key Document:**
   - Create a separate, restricted-access document to maintain the key that links participant identifiers to their actual names. This document should be accessible only to authorized team members.

3. **Reference the Key:**
   - In your interview notes, refer to participants only by their unique identifier. Avoid using any personal details that could inadvertently reveal their identity.

4. **Ensure Consistency:**
   - Use the same format for all participant identifiers across different interviews to maintain consistency and ease of tracking.

### Final Tips

- **Check Permissions:** Ensure the copied page has the appropriate permissions set, especially if the original page had restricted access.
- **Regular Updates:** If conducting multiple interviews, update the key document regularly to avoid confusion.
- **Data Protection:** Always follow your organization's data protection policies when handling personal information.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create anonymized records of your user research interviews while maintaining a reference system for participant identification.
